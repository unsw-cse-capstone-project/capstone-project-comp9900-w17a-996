Week 1

Group formed. I created Jira account and joined the Jira and Github groups. 
I discussed with group members which project topic to choose, and available software tools.

Week 2

I wrote the user story and learnt some knowledge about the technology we are going to use.
I also wrote some demo about font-end part to practice.
Next week, I plan to do the diagram for the software architecture.

Week 3

I wrote the system architecture diagram of the proposal. We had an group meeting about the project
assignment. I will do the font-end part in this project.
Next week, I plan to do the font-end of the user stories that we will do in the first sprint.

Week4

I finished the front-end part which is assigned to me in the first sprint. some part of them cannot connet
with the back-end part, so I will solve this problem in next week. Also, I will go into the second sprint.

Week5

We finished our first progressive demo (A), and our group had a meeting about the Retrospective.
Through the meeting, we know what should be improved in the next sprint, and also we make it clear how to complete
the sprint more efficiently. In the next week, we will continue to the second sprint.
