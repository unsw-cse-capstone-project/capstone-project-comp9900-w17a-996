Week 1

Group formed. I created Jira and joined the Jira and Github group. 
I discussed with group members which project topic to choose, and available software tools.

Week 2

I wrote some user story and learnt some knowledge about the technology we are going to use.
I also wrote some demo about font-end part to practice.
Next week, I plan to do the diagram for the software architecture.
