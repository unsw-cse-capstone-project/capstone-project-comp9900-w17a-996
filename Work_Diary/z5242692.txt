Week 1

Group formed. I registered group on Jira and invited my teammates and tutor to join. 
We discussed on which project topic and develop techniques to choose. I started learning related skills that will be used.


Week 2

I wrote user stories on Jira backlog with my teammates.
We assigned different tasks of the project proposal to different person. I checked useful tools to be used for storyboards drawing.


Week 3

I finished the "interface and flow diagram" section of the project proposal with Binbin. 
After that, I filled in the "User story and sprint" section, then finalised the whole document and submitted.
We assigned team roles of developing and started the first sprint. 
I am still learning React.js. Next week, I'll pretty much dive into the actual coding.


Week 4

I finished the front-end of register, login and profile page. And finish data communication with back-end teammates.
Merge the project from different parts. Prepare for the demo next week.
