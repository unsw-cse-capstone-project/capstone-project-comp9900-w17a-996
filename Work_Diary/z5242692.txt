Week 1

Group formed. I registered group on Jira and invited my teammates and tutor to join. 
We discussed on which project topic and develop techniques to choose. I started learning related skills that will be used.


Week 2

I wrote user stories on Jira backlog with my teammates.
We assigned different tasks of the project proposal to different person. I checked useful tools to be used for storyboards drawing.


Week 3

I finished the "interface and flow diagram" section of the project proposal with Binbin. 
After that, I filled in the "User story and sprint" section, then finalised the whole document and submitted.
We assigned team roles of developing and started the first sprint. 
I am still learning React.js. Next week, I'll pretty much dive into the actual coding.


Week 4

I finished the front-end of register, login and profile page. And finish data communication with back-end teammates.
Merge the project from different parts. Prepare for the demo next week.


Week 5

I fixed some small bugs before the demo. Demo A finished. We held the sprint retrospective to review the first Sprint.
I submitted the retrospective report. Then, we assigned tasks for Sprint 2 and started the sprint. 
Next week, I will code for my part of Sprint 2 and keep on debugging the Sprint 1.


Week 6
I finished my coding part of Sprint 2 and fixed some bugs left from Sprint 1.
Merge our code together, Sprint 2 finished. Next week, we will hold Sprint 2 retro meeting and start Sprint 3. Busy week.


Week 7
Add other profile page, complete follow & ban list. Keep helping data interaction between back-end & front-end.
Restruct profile page. Manually merge teammates' work to master. Another busy week.
